Project description: 
As an international student, I consider two places as home: one where I was born and raised, and the other where I have spent most of my time in the past three years. This is why I have put in my best efforts to make the place I currently live feel like home and create a cozy setting for myself. Sometimes, I spend entire days in my dormitory, either studying or engaging in enjoyable activities. In this project, my goal is to convey the atmosphere of my dorm room and its comforting and cozy vibes.

Implementation process: 
Initially, I determined the sections that would be included on my website. Subsequently, I created these sections and their corresponding titles in the HTML file. I then proceeded to implement each section one by one. I began with the header, which included navigation and a main banner with titles. Following that, I implemented the slider for the next section, temporarily using placeholder images. This part was the most difficult for me because of its complex algorithmic logic. Later, I uploaded my video to YouTube and incorporated it into the third section. Finally, I edited some images and replaced the placeholders in the slider.

Challenges: 
While I believe I successfully executed the project I had in mind when I began, two aspects did not align with my initial expectations. Firstly, I had originally planned to include four sections, with the fourth being a Contact section. However, implementing this required knowledge of creating forms and designing them, which I did not have the time to explore thoroughly. Secondly, I initially intended to have a sticky navigation bar at the top of the page. However, after implementing it, I decided to use arrows instead to maintain a linear flow on the webpage. This decision also influenced my choice to make each section the height of the window. I think that way I could achieve a better storytelling experience.
